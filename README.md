# Useful BATCH scripts

A collection of scripts to simplify some every day repetitive tasks. Shared mostly for educational purposes or to make your life just a bit simpler.

Most scripts are written from scratch by me but also some scripts from the following repos are included: [Batchography](https://github.com/PassingTheKnowledge/Batchography).

Each script contains a bit of documentation as comment at the beginning of the file. **They may include bugs**, always double check that the script does.
